# Changelog

## Unreleased

! upcoming version will be `3.0.0` of __nichtparasoup__ !
see the [milestone tracking at github](https://github.com/k4cg/nichtparasoup/milestone/2).

* Breaking changes
  * Requires `python>=3.6` (was `python>=3.5`) now.
  * CommandLine Interface overhaul. See cli help via `nichtparasoup --help`.
    * CLI is done via `click` now.
    * Shell completion was removed temporary. See the [issue](https://github.com/k4cg/nichtparasoup/issues/226).
    * Proper subcommands are used now.
  * API: `Crawler.type` of to `status/crawlers` API is now a fill qualified class name.
      See the [docs](docs/web_api/status_crawlers.md).  
      The old short-typed version is still available as the optional `Crawler.name` 
      (optional means: can be missing or `null`, if manually added).
  * Package `nichtparasoup.imagecrawler` was renamed to `nichtparasoup.imagecrawlers`.
    Everything needed to implement an imagecrawler was moved to a clean module `nichtparasoup.imagecrawler`.
  * Class `nichtparasoup.testing.config.ConfigFileTest` was moved to `nichtparasoup.testing.configfile.ConfigFileTest`.

* Changes
  * Class `nichtparasoup.core.server.ServerStatus` is not abstract anymore.
  * `nichtparasoup.VERSION` was moved to `nichtparasoup.__version__`, therefore
      `nichtparasoup.__version__` is no longer a module but a string.
  * Package `nichtparasoup.testing` got a huge overhaul. 
    * Classes do no longer implement `unittets.Testcase` anymore.
    * Functionality was split into chunks for easier use.
    * Class `.configfile.ConfigFileTest` (previously named `.config.ConfigFileTest`) was reworked.
    * Class `.imagecrawler.FileFetcher` supports fully qualified urls now, including schema and netloc.
      Therefore an optional parameter `base_url` was added.

* Added
  * API: `Crawler.name` to `status/crawlers` API. See the [docs](docs/web_api/status_crawlers.md).
  * Public CLI modules `nichtparasoup.commands.*` for use via `python3 -m`:
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.imagecrawler_desc`
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.imagecrawler_list`
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.server_config_check`
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.server_config_dump_defaults`
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.server_run`
  * Public CLI module `nichtparasoup.cli.main` for use via `python3 -m`.
  * Class `nichtparasoup.testing.config.ConfigTest` was added.
  * Property `nichtparasoup.core.server.Server.stats` was made available to the public.
  * Implementations of `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawer.BaseImageCrawler`
    * Function `get_internal_name()` to return the internal name.
      If instance was made via `nichtparasoup.config.get_imagecrawler()` the value is set
      to represent the "name" from the config.
    * Property `internal_name` - read-only shortcut for `get_internal_name()`.
    * Function `__str__()` .  
      Returns `<NamedImagecrawler {INTERNAL_NAME} {CONFIG}>` if `internal_name` is set, 
      otherwise the behaviour falls back to `__repr__()`.

Removed:
  * `nichtparasoup.core.server.type_module_name_str()`

* Misc
  * Build process is now isolated and conform to
    [PEP517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) &
    [PEP518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/).  
    *ATTENTION*: `pip install`'s `--editable` flag might requires the `--no-build-isolation` flag.
  * Improved some [docs](docs).
  * internal
    * All internal imports were made relative (again).
    * Logging reviewed, uses %-strings as params, now.
    * `try`/`except` got some overhaul to cover needed parts, only.
    * CLI is now powered by [`click`](https://click.palletsprojects.com).
      Was made via `argparse` before.
  * Removed `ddt` from the testing dependencies. Closes [issue #233](https://github.com/k4cg/nichtparasoup/issues/233).
