# contribute


you find a crawler missing or not working? feel free to fill the gaps.

writing a crawler will take less than half an hour. just grab one of the existing implementations, copy it, modify it, 
test it.  
see also: [development docu](development.md)

if you like, you may also contribute a logo for the frontend. just follow the instructions from the 
`nichtparasoup/webserver/htdocs/css/sourceIcons.css` file.
