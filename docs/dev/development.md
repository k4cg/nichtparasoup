Install the requirements: `ptyhon3 -m pip install -e .[development]`.   
Then just do whatever you would like.

After writing the code have the code fixed via 
[`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) and 
[`autopep3`](https://pypi.org/project/autopep3/).   
These tools are already installed via `development` dependencies.

Do not forget to [test](testing.md) the code.   
This will also check for 
import order(fix via `isort`) 
and pycodestyle(fixevia `autopep8`)
