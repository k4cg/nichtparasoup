This documentation is work in progress.

## Backend

Install the requirements: `python -m pip install .[development]`.  
*ATTENTION*: `pip install`'s `--editable` flag might requires the `--no-build-isolation` flag.

After writing the code have the code fixed via
[`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) and
[`autopep3`](https://pypi.org/project/autopep3/).   
These tools are already installed via `development` dependencies.

Do not forget to [test](testing.md) the code.  
This will also check for
import order (fix via `isort`) and
pycodestyle (fix via `autopep8`).
