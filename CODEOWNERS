# This file provides an overview of code owners in this repository.
# See https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners. They will be requested for review when someone opens
# a pull request.
# The last matching pattern has the most precedence.

# These people will be the default owners for everything in the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence.
