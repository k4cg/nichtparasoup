# Changelog

## 3.0.0

Unreleased

-- see the [milestone tracking at github](https://github.com/k4cg/nichtparasoup/milestone/2).

* Breaking Changes
  * Imagecrawler for Instagram is no more part of standard distribution.
    It might come back as a plugin one day.  
    This crawler was just too brittle because of Instagram's WebApplicationFirewalls and other bot protections.
* Changes
  * Web-API supports HTTP method "GET" only. Did support all HTTP methods in the past.
  * Property `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.weight` got getter & setter to reflect value constraints.
  * Methods `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.get_is_image_addable()`
          & `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.set_is_image_addable()` were removed.  
    They are replaced by a new property `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.is_image_addable`.
  * Method `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.set_image_added()`
         & `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.get_image_added()` were removed.  
    They are replaced by a new property `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.image_added`.
* Added
  * New method `nichtparasoup.server.has_image() -> bool`.
  * New property `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.is_image_addable` with getter, setter.
    Support any kind of Callable now, formerly supported `MethodType` only.
  * New property `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.image_added` with getter, setter.
    Support any kind of Callable now, formerly supported `MethodType` only.
* Fixes
  * API `/get` no longer responds false "404 EXHAUSTED" HTTP Status code.
  * `nichtparasoup.server.get_image()` no longer responds false `None`.
* Removed
  * Crawler `nichtparasoup.imagecrawlers.instagram` was removed from shipped imagecrawlers.
* Misc
  * Tests were restructured and rewritten. Therefore made some functions/methods more testable.

## 3.0.0a2

Released 2020-10-18

* Added
  * `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawler.RemoteFetcher` got the ability to write communication logs.  
    The log target dir is controlled via env var `NP_DEBUG_REMOTEFETCHER_STOREDIR`.  
    The log target dir must exist and be writeable.
  * Crawler `nichtparasoup.imagecrawlers.instagram.InstagramProfile` got a new optional config: `profile_id`.  
    See the [InstagramProfile's docs](docs/imagecrawlers/instagram_profile.md) for details.
  * All functions that take a path to a server's config file now support `pathlib.PathLike`,
    and still support `str` like before.
  * New optional config setting `imageserver.reset_timeout`.  Its default value is `3600`.  
    See the [docs](docs/config/index.md).
* Changes
  * Config setting `imageserver.crawler_upkeep` is optional, now. Its default value is `30`.  
    See the [docs](docs/config/index.md).
  * JSON API responses
    * `/get` now sends valid JSON when a "404" occurred. See the [docs](docs/web-api/get.md).
    * `/reset` now sends HTTP status code "202", was "200".
* Misc
  * Tests can persist logs of `nichtparasoup` - controlled via env var `NP_TESTLOG_NAME`.  
    If the env var is present:
    * A directory is created: `./tests/.logs/${NP_TESTLOG_NAME}`.  
    * The env var `NP_DEBUG_REMOTEFETCHER_STOREDIR` defaults to `./tests/.logs/${NP_TESTLOG_NAME}`.  
    Tests via `tox` enable these logs per default and will add a suffix to `NP_TESTLOG_NAME`: `_{envname}`

## 3.0.0a1

Released 2020-09-05

* Breaking changes
  * Requires `python>=3.6` -- was `python>=3.5`.
  * [CommandLine Interface](docs/run/index.md) overhaul. See cli help via `nichtparasoup --help`.
    * CLI is done via [`click`](https://click.palletsprojects.com) now (was done via `argparse` before).
    * Shell completion was removed temporary. See the [issue](https://github.com/k4cg/nichtparasoup/issues/226).
    * Proper subcommands are used now.  
      Also available via `python3 -m nichtparasoup.commands.*` - see in added feature section below.
  * Web-API: 
    * `version` of `/status/server` was moved to `/status`.
    * `Crawler.type` of `/status/crawlers` is now a full qualified class name.
      See the [docs](docs/web_api/status/crawlers.md).  
      The old short-typed version is still available as the optional `Crawler.name` 
      (optional means: can be missing or `null`, if manually added).
  * Package `nichtparasoup.imagecrawler` was renamed to `nichtparasoup.imagecrawlers`.
    Everything needed to implement an imagecrawler was moved to a clean module `nichtparasoup.imagecrawler`.
  * Class `nichtparasoup.testing.config.ConfigFileTest` was moved to `nichtparasoup.testing.configfile.ConfigFileTest`.
    Also it behaves different now. Read the code and annotations for a deeper insight.
  * Some Class methods of `nichtparasoup.core.server.Server` got reworked return types:
    * `Server.get_image()` returns optional `nichtparasoup.core.server.ImageResponse` -- was optional `dict`.
    * `Server.refill()` returns `None` -- was `dict`.
    * `Server.request_reset()` returns `nichtparasoup.core.server.ResetResponse` -- was `dict`.
  * Changes to `nichtparasoup.core.ServerRefiller.__init__()`: 
    * Parameter `sleep` was renamed to `delay` and is nof `loat` (was `int` or `float`). 
  * Class `nichtparasoup.core.server.Status` was removed.  
    Its former static methods that returned dictionaries were reworked to be DataClasses:
    * `nichtparasoup.core.server.ServerStatus`    -- replaces `.Status.server()`.
    * `nichtparasoup.core.server.CrawlerStatus`   -- replaces `.Status.crawlers()`.
    * `nichtparasoup.core.server.BlacklistStatus` -- replaces `.Status.blacklist()`.
  * Removed the install-extras `development` and `testing`.
  * Defaulting arguments of `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.__init__()` became kwargs.
  * Arguments of `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler.fill_up_to()` changed:
    * `filled_by` became a kwarg.
    * `timeout` became a kwarg and was renamed to `delay`.
  * Arguments of `nichtparasoup.core.NPCore.fill_up_to()` changed:
    * `on_refill` became a kwarg.
    * `timeout` became a kwarg and was renamed to `delay`.
  * Some arguments of `nichtparasoup.core.NPCore.add_imagecrawler()` became kwargs and got default values.
  * Arguments of `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawler.RemoteFetcher` became kwargs.
  * Method `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawler.BaseImageCrawler.__init__()` became abstract 
    in favour of proper argument definition and typing in implementations
  * All builtin imagecrawlers' `__init__()` got proper argument definition and typing
    as they are implementations of `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawler.BaseImageCrawler.__init__()`.
  * Package `nichtparasoup.testing` got a huge overhaul. 
    * Classes do no longer implement `unittets.TestCase` anymore.
    * Functionality was split into chunks for easier use.
    * Class `.configfile.ConfigFileTest` (previously named `.config.ConfigFileTest`) was reworked.
    * Class `.imagecrawler.FileFetcher` supports fully qualified urls now, including schema and netloc.
      Therefore an optional argument `base_url` was added.
  * Server's imagecrawler can get exhausted when the crawling source's end is reached.
    Resolves [issue #152](https://github.com/k4cg/nichtparasoup/issues/152).
* Removed:
  * `nichtparasoup.core.server.type_module_name_str()`
  * `development` and `testing` extras were removed. replaced by files in `requirements/` folder. See "changes".
* Changes
  * Method `nichtparasoup.code.Crawler.crawl()` returns number of actually added images, was number of crawled images.
  * `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawler.ImageRecognizer` also detects `.webp`.
  * `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawler.BaseImageCrawler` does not call `self._reset()` on first run anymore.
  * Class `nichtparasoup.core.server.ServerStatus` is not abstract anymore.
  * `nichtparasoup.VERSION` was moved to `nichtparasoup.__version__`, therefore
    `nichtparasoup.__version__` is no longer a module but a string.
  * Install-extras `development` and `testing` were changed to be separate (`pip-compile`d pinned) files:
    * [dev requirements](requirements/dev.txt)
    * [tests requirements](requirements/tests.txt)
* Fixed
  * False-positives in `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawler.ImageRecognizer.path_is_image()`.
  * Fixed a possible endless loop of `nichtparasoup.code.Crawler.fill_up_to()`.
* Added
  * Web-API: `Crawler.name` to `status/crawlers` API. See the [docs](docs/web_api/status/crawlers.md).
  * Public CLI package `nichtparasoup.cli` for use via `python3 -m`.
  * Public CLI command modules for use via `python3 -m`:
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.imagecrawler_desc`
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.imagecrawler_list`
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.server_config_check`
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.server_config_dump_defaults`
    * `nichtparasoup.commands.server_run`
  * Class `nichtparasoup.webserver.WebServer` got an optional argument `developer_mode` (default: `False`)
    which enables an insecure web-developer mode and sets
    [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) to "*".
  * Class `nichtparasoup.testing.config.ConfigTest` was added.
  * Property `nichtparasoup.core.server.Server.stats` was made available to the public.
  * New classes in `nichtparasoup.core.server` were added to 
    represent response types of `nichtparasoup.core.server.Server`'s methods:
    * `.ResetResponse` represents response of `.Server.request_reset()`.
    * `.ImageResponse` represents response of `.Server.get_image()`.
  * New DataClasses were added to module `nichtparasoup.core.server`:
    * `.ServerStatus`
    * `.CrawlerStatus`
    * `.BlacklistStatus`
  * `nichtparasoup.core.Crawler` got a new kwarg `restart_at_front_when_exhausted`.  
    `nichtparasoup.core.NPCore.add_imagecrawler()` got a new kwarg `restart_at_front_when_exhausted`.  
    See the [docs](docs/config/index.md)
  * Implementations of `nichtparasoup.core.imagecrawer.BaseImageCrawler` got new features:
    * Method `.get_internal_name()` to return the internal name.
      If instance was made via `nichtparasoup.config.get_imagecrawler()` the value is set
      to represent the "name" from the config.
    * Property `.internal_name` - read-only shortcut for method `.get_internal_name()`.
    * Method `.__str__()` .  
      Returns `<NamedImagecrawler {INTERNAL_NAME} {CONFIG!r}>` if `internal_name` is set, 
      otherwise the behaviour falls back to `__repr__()`.
  * Public stuff in module `nichtparasoup.imagecrawers.instagram` (was nonpublic before):
    * Class `.BaseInstagramCrawler` became public. (since it does `Lock()` allocation automatically, now.)
    * Class `.InstagramQueryHashFinder` became public for extending `.BaseInstagramCrawler`.
    * Constants `.INSTAGRAM_URL_ROOT` and `.INSTAGRAM_ICON_URL` became public for extending `.BaseInstagramCrawler`.
* Misc
  * Build process is now isolated and conform to
    [PEP517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) &
    [PEP518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/).  
    *ATTENTION*: `pip install`'s `--editable` flag might requires the `--no-build-isolation` flag.
  * Improved some [docs](docs/index.md). Added an `index.md` to all folders. restructured some docs.
  * Internal
    * All internal imports were made relative.
    * Logging reviewed, uses `%`-strings as params, now.
    * `try`/`except` got some overhaul to cover needed parts, only.
  * Removed `ddt` from the testing dependencies. Closes [issue #233](https://github.com/k4cg/nichtparasoup/issues/233).
  * Version-bumped some dependencies, pinned dev dependencies via `pip-compile`.
  * Added some more tests.
  * improved `venv` support when it comes to testing.
  * Tests via `tox` were split.
    Code style tests are done via own test named `style` now (was part of standard tests).
  * Repo layout changed to be a monorepo. See [the repo](https://github.com/k4cg/nichtparasoup).  
    This also means, that the plugin-example was moved out of the project into an own project.
