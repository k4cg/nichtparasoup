_nichtparasoup_ is a hackspaces entertainment system.
It randomly displays images from
[pr0gramm](https://pr0gramm.com) and
[reddit](https://reddit.com).  
Other crawlers are currently removed, but might be back soon as plugins.

If you find an ImageCrawler for your favourite ImageBoard missing, feel free to write your own ImageCrawler for it.  
Contribute it to the _nichtparasoup_ project or use it as an independent plugin :-)

At our hackspace [k4cg](https://k4cg.org) we've been using it for years now.  
It has proven to be a very non-invasive way of entertaining a crowd of nerds 
without having the noise and interruptions of videos or other stuff.

Here is what it looks like in your browser

and even better, on a video projector in your local hackspace!

## How it works

Images are crawled from multiple public pre-configured sources.  
No image is actually downloaded, only the URLs to images are gathered. Found images are kept in a list
to make sure the same URL is never gathered twice.

To show the crawled images, _nichtparasoup_ starts a web-server that displays a web UI.  
The web UI fetches one random image URL from the _nichtparasoup_ server at a time. 

The web UI will load new images continuously, unless one of the following events happen:
* paused manually in the web UI
* scroll position in web UI is not on top
* window or tab lost focus
* web UI is in image theater/zoom mode
* boss mode is active in web UI

In the web UI the images are downloaded from the original source. The original source is linked and marked by
an icon. Just hover over or click the icon in the bottom right of an image to get there.

Every time _nichtparasoup_ serves an image URL it also removes it from its list. This means an image URL is served
only once - unless the server was reset. (This might change in the future)
