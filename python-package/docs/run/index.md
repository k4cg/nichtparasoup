## run server  

`nichtparasoup server run`
simply runs a server.

use a custom config for the server. If omitted, the default is used. to write your own config, see the sections below.

when you start _nichtparasoup_
1. system will fill up cache by startup
1. system starts up the web-server
1. you point your browser to the configured localhost:5000/ or whatever is configured in the config
1. start page will request single images randomly by /get and show it
1. when system's cache is empty, it will be refilled by the crawler automatically
1. you will (hopefully) get new results.

every time you restart _nichtparasoup_, the cache forgets about its previously shown images.  
There is no persistence.
